# Claude Code Plugins by Carlos Lezama

A collection of Claude Code plugins for systematic development workflows and productivity enhancement.

## Available Plugins

### Research-Design-Implement

A systematic workflow plugin that guides Claude through three structured phases for code changes:

1. **Research** - Thoroughly explore and understand the codebase
2. **Design** - Create detailed implementation roadmap with success criteria
3. **Implement** - Execute plan with automated and manual verification

**Use cases:**
- Complex features touching multiple files
- Refactoring with significant scope
- Features requiring architectural decisions
- Tasks needing careful planning

**Documentation:** [plugins/research-design-implement/README.md](plugins/research-design-implement/README.md)
